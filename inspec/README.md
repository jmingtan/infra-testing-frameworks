# terratest example

Sample test cases for evaluating [InSpec](https://inspec.io) using
Docker. Note that this test uses an older version of InSpec (3.9.3) as
binaries for newer versions are subject to license restrictions.

To see InSpec in action, run:

    docker-compose up
    
Afterwards, you can clean up the environment with:

    docker-compose down
